# goparsy

GoLang implementation of the [PyParsy](https://github.com/vkolev/pyparsy) package

This project is just for fun, at the end it should be fully compatible version of the PyParsy package
and should support all the features.

The updated README and documentation will follow once, all the functionality is implemented as desired.
